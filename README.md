# Passify-Password-Manager

Passify is an online password manager designed keeping in mind the growing need of remembering lots of passwords. Internet applications have seen an exponential growth over the years and as new services come into existence, we tend to register ourselves using username and password. With the projected growth, it will soon be impossible to remember the passwords of each and every service that one uses and ***Passify*** comes to the rescue.
